About AWS services/tools:    
 
   **AWS ECS:**  Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a container orchestration/management service similar to Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. 
 Itâ€™s a highly scalable and high-performance service that comes with Docker pre-installed. 
 It allows applications/containers to run on top of EC2 hosts.
 
   **AWS ECR:** Similar to the Docker hub, Amazon has a feature called Elastic Container Register, which allows you to deploy your Docker container to AWS.
